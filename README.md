## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alvi. I do Data Analytic and Software Development. I enjoy working with data, learning programming languages, and data analytic tools like Python, SQL, Pandas, and Tableau. I am also curious about exploring code as a Software Engineer. You can find me experimenting with data-driven projects and contributing to open-source initiatives.
